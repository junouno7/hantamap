mobile clicknode exitsearch exit popup, search move more gracefully  


 when using this app in the mobile device view in chrome, after clicking the zoom in out button or the reset button,
 the button remains highlighted blue instead of returning back to normal as soon as I let go. Also, clicking on the nodes doesn't
  bring up the popup information.
  does touch mode normally not work in google chrome mobile device view? or is there something wrong with the app
